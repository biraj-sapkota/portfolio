                    reading and learning processes. Talking about now, the severe rise of the worldwide pandemic of
                    COVID-19 had affected many fields including education. But the technology had made an alternate way
                    for the learning processes. Students can attend the classes right at their home through several
                    means. They can fully revise and go through the content afterwards as well through recorded session
                    videos.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Moving on students can research for several new things online. They could enhance their knowledge on
                    newer things. Moreover, several institutions and colleges had been providing free or low cost online
                    classes which might be a beneficial for the students. Students can also communicate to the experts
                    online for several reasons. Additionally, free e-library provided by many institutions can be used

                    As is said there would always be a negative aspect for every good one, same things hold true for the
                    technology as well. The vulnerable things that the technology had brought are highly affecting the
                    people’s behaviour, physical health and many more. Lots of people are engaged in different criminal
                    activities through the means of technology like hacking, piracy, etc. which is not a good aspect.
                    Secondly, due to the ease that the technology has made people wants to stay within his /her room
                    rather being exposed to the people around. Lack of physical exercise and walk has made the people
                    suffer from several diseases. In addition to, retina of eyes is totally affected by the rays from
                    gadgets making them depress and stressful. Due to this, many people are being mentally challenged
                    nowadays.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    To sum up, students are also suffering from the access use of devices in their physical, mental as
                    well as social health. Small children are compelled to wear spectacles in their child age due to the
                    excess use of gadgets and devices. Several problems like insomnia, depression and eye-problem are
                    arising day by day. So, everyone must be concern about the harmful effects of its excessive use.
