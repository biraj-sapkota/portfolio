            <p>The previous photo is of the website which I had taken as a reference while second one is my webpage. In
                that website, the author had made his navigation bar by placing a ‘div’ tag inside a main ‘div’ tag
                followed by a ‘header’ tag. Inside the ‘header’ is again a ‘div’ tag and finally an ‘a’ tag has been
                used to link different pages. Whereas, in my case I had defined a ‘nav’ tag inside which a non- list
                style type ‘ul’ tag is placed within which the links formed from ‘a’ tag are placed in a ‘li’ tag
                displaying the content inline. </p>
        </div>

        <hr>

        <div class="two">
            <!--div tags for class two-->
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <img src="images/b.JPG" alt="photo">
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <img src="images/b(1).JPG" alt="myphoto">
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>The first webpage owner uses three nested ‘div’ tags followed by a ‘section’ under which five ‘div’ tags
                are placed in a nested form. These all tags are finally followed by an ‘img’ tag where the photos are
                attached to display in the webpage. Instead, I had created a single ‘img’ tag with defined class name
                inside a ‘div’ tag followed by a ‘figure’ tag and invoked the java script function for slideshow of the
                five different images every 3 seconds stored in the array. This function invokes automatically when the
                page is loaded.</p>
        </div>

            <table>
                <!--keeping the content row-wise by using table-->
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <img src="images/c.JPG" alt="footer">

                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>The first photo is the picture of a website that uses a link for linking the author’s fb page, Instagram
                and many other social medias. For this, he kept an extra ‘div’ tag inside a main ‘div’ tag followed by
                an ‘a’ tag ended with an ‘img’ tag. The picture of social medias is placed inside ‘img’ tag to make it
                as a link so did I. But I had a footer tag inside which ‘ul’ tag is used to list photo link using ‘li’.
                Inside, ‘li’ tag there comes an ‘a’ tag followed by ‘img’ tag. </p>
        </div>

                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>The author of the webpage shown in first part creates a place using ‘section’ tag inside which is the
                ‘main’ tag. Within it, there are two ‘div’ tags which are followed by the form tag where block of codes
                is written to create a form. In mine webpage, I kept ‘article’ tag inside which a ‘div’ tag exists.
                Inside it comes another ‘div’ tag where the form tag is actually placed and several form-making codes
                are placed within it.</p>

                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>For creating blogs, the author has kept a ‘main’ tag inside a ‘div’ tag which is followed by 3 different
                ‘div’ tags in nested form. The last ‘div’ tag contains ‘article’ tag inside which again it’s a ‘div’
                tag. Finally, several texts are written inside this ‘div’ tag in a ‘p’ tag. I had also made an ‘article’
                tag which is followed by two nested ‘div’ tags under which a ‘p’ tag is defined to present several
                blocks of text.</p>
